            <li class="line" id="line1">I still remember the cold december night</li>
            <li class="line" id="line2">How warm my friends house was and</li>
            <li class="line" id="line3">How comforting was the lamps warm white light,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line4">My friend was hosting a party and needed a hand</li>
            <li class="line" id="line5">Trying to luminate the dull rental walls with festival light,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line6">Soon enough the house was filled with faces and voices</li>
            <li class="line" id="line7">Talking, Laughing, Gasping and making all sorts of noises.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="verse" id="verse2">
            <li class="line" id="line1">I took a chair and sat with a jolly group</li>
            <li class="line" id="line2">Introduced myself hoping to find someone new,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line3">They greeted me with a smile and a lot of compassion</li>
            <li class="line" id="line4">But they were already lost in stories that I barely knew,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line5">Soon the voices turned into hum and my mind buzzed with confusion</li>
            <li class="line" id="line6">The room was not warm anymore and the lights faced occlusion,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line7">I asked myself, “When did this clique turn into a crowd?”</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="verse" id="verse3">
            <li class="line" id="line1">Today, I was not alone but lonely</li>

            <li class="line" id="line1">I still remember the hot july morning,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line2">How cold my own house was and </li>
            <li class="line" id="line3">How energizing was the suns playful light,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line4">I made myself a brunch listening to my favorite band</li>
            <li class="line" id="line5">Trying to catch up with the tunes while getting the words right,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line6">Soon I had nothing to do and was out of choices</li>
            <li class="line" id="line7">Singing, Tapping, Clapping and making all sorts of noises.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="verse" id="verse5">
            <li class="line" id="line1">I took a book and sat with my glasses on</li>
            <li class="line" id="line2">Picked up where I left off hoping to reach the epilogue,</li>
            <li class="line" id="line3">Poured myself a fresh cup of coffee and had some cookies on the side</li>
            <li class="line" id="line4">Read a few pages before I was lost in stories those printed words hide</li>
            <li class="line" id="line5">Soon, the cup was empty but my thoughts flowed like a riptide</li>
            <li class="line" id="line6">The sun was bright, and my hope was amplified</li>
            <li class="line" id="line7">I asked myself,  “When did my house turn into a home?”</li>
          </ul>
